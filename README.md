# Chip-8 Emulator

## Introduction

Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language developed by Joseph Weisbecker in the mid-1970s. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers to make game programming easier. The language itself is simple, with only 35 opcodes and 4K of memory space. However, it is a great starting point for beginners to learn about emulation and how to write an emulator.

This project is a work-in-progress Chip-8 emulator written in pure Javascript. The emulator should soon be capable of running Chip-8 ROMs and has a simple GUI to load ROMs and control the emulator.

## How to Run

To run the emulator, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. You can then load a Chip-8 ROM and start the emulator.
